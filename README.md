# SIEMX â€“ Modern SIEM Platform with DevSecOps Automation

*SIEMX* is a next-generation, modular Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution that integrates DevSecOps practices to provide fast, scalable, and automated threat detection and response capabilities. It is designed to address the core limitations of traditional SIEM systems, such as high false positives, delayed responses, and manual remediation, by embedding automation and secure practices across the software development and deployment lifecycle.


Cyber threats are evolving rapidly, and organizationsâ€”especially SMEsâ€”struggle to keep up using legacy SIEM systems that lack speed, adaptability, and automation. SIEMX was developed to overcome these issues by implementing:

- *Real-time log analysis* using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana).
- *Rule-based threat detection* with signature matching and anomaly recognition.
- *Automated vulnerability scanning and remediation* using tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- *Secure log handling* using end-to-end encryption and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- *Self-healing mechanisms* to automatically mitigate detected vulnerabilities.
- *Dark web monitoring* to identify compromised credentials or data exposures.

By combining proactive monitoring, rule-based alerting, and DevSecOps integration, SIEMX offers a powerful solution for both enterprise and SME environments.

## âš™ Key Features
- Secure Log Transmission:* Uses TLS and AES-256 encryption to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of logs during collection and transport.
- Real-Time Analysis:* Processes logs and generates alerts with sub-2-second latency using Elasticsearch and Logstash.
- Rule-Based Detection:* Uses pre-configured and customizable detection rules to identify known attack patterns and behavioral anomalies.
- DevSecOps Integration:* Automates security scans in CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using Trivy) to catch vulnerabilities before deployment.
- Automated Remediation:* Executes self-healing scripts when critical vulnerabilities are detected, reducing the need for manual intervention. Dark Web Monitoring:* Continuously scans breach and leak databases to alert users about - potential compromises.
- User-Friendly Dashboards:* Kibana-powered visualizations make complex event data easy to understand, even for junior analysts.
- Dockerized Deployment:* Each component is containerized for modular, scalable, and quick deployment across test or production environments.
- Future-Proof Design:* Supports cloud-native expansion and integration with threat intelligence feeds and blockchain for immutable logging.



 Test Results & Performance

- *Alert Latency:* < 2 seconds (average across test scenarios)
- *False Positives Reduction:* Up to 60% using custom rules
- *Incident Response Time Improvement:* 40% faster than legacy SIEMs
- *Threat Detection Speed:* 35% faster than conventional tools
- *Manual Workload Reduction:* 40% improvement through automation

SIEMX was tested in isolated Docker containers simulating real-world network logs, syslogs, and attack traffic. The automation scripts were evaluated in a continuous integration setup with simulated vulnerabilities injected via insecure dependencies and outdated packages.


SIEMX is built on a modular architecture with the following components:

- *Filebeat:* Collects logs from systems and applications.
- *Logstash:* Parses, filters, and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.
- *Elasticsearch:* Stores and indexes logs for fast search and correlation.
- *Kibana:* Provides interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- *CI/CD Pipeline:* Automates security scans, deployment, and remediation.
- *Self-Healing Engine:* Executes scripts in response to high-severity findings.
- *Dark Web Monitor:* Uses open-source APIs to detect credential leaks.

Each module can be independently deployed and configured, making SIEMX ideal for various deployment scales and use cases.




1. *Enhance threat visibility* using real-time log monitoring and dynamic alerting.
2. *Accelerate response times* through automation and rapid remediation.
3. *Embed security into development workflows* via CI/CD integration.
4. *Make SIEM affordable and usable* for SMEs by simplifying dashboard usage and deployment.
5. *Improve compliance readiness* with encryption, access control, and log integrity features.
